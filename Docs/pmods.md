# Using Pmods

The Pmod Connection system is using a grid of 2 rows and 6 columns of pins.

It was designed by Digilent to offer something compatible with both classical jumper wires used on breadboards,
and a standardised pinout that supports multiple protocols on the same connector.

This is popular on FPGA boards as it permits them to support any protocol over
the same connector with the right pinout, rarely possible on MCUs.

This standard is documented [here](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/pmod/pmodoledrgb/pmodoledrgb_sch.pdf).

## Pmod in the pico-ice

Here is an [example of how to solder](md_getting__started.html#autotoc_md2) the Pmod connectors.

There are 4 Pmod connectors in the pico-ice, numbered clockwise from 1 to 4 starting from the USB connector.

- 2 connected to the iCE40
- 1 connected to both the RP2350 and iCE40
- 1 connected to the RP2350

The pinout of the RP2350 is made to be compatible with SPI0,
with the other protocols that may be bit-banged or implemented with PIO to be pin-compatible.

For the iCE40, the pin numbers are available from
[pico_ice.pcf](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/rtl/pico_ice.pcf).

## Pmod Modules

There are many Pmod vendors, and this page attempts to enumerate as many as possible.

If you have made a Pmod module, let us know and we would add it to this list!
