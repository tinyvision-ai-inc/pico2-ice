The pico2-ice is a small, low cost board with the Raspberry Pi Pico processor ([RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/silicon.html#rp2350)) and a Lattice Semiconductor [iCE40UP5K](https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40UltraPlus) FPGA. The board features independent flash for the FPGA and RP2350, low power PSRAM, a couple of pushbuttons and a two 3 color LED with _all_ FPGA and RP2350 pins brought out to easy to use 0.1" header pins (arranged as Pmod's) for fast prototyping.
