## With RTL on the iCE40

To program the FPGA, one needs to tell the synthesis tools which pins to connect to the signals in your RTL.  There are two different ways to name the pins.   The wafer names are words like `IOB_6a` and `IOT_8b`, and the pin numbers have names like `ICE_2`, `ICE_3`, and `ICE_4`.
Both sets of names can be found in this [PCF file](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/rtl/pico_ice.pcf).

## With code on the RP2350

The FPGA pins and other signals are defined in [`pico_ice.h`](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/pico2-ice_develop/include/boards/pico2_ice.h).

The PMOD pins can also be accessed from
[`ice_pmod.h`](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/pico2-ice_develop/include/ice_pmod.h).

## SPI Pinouts 

For debugging the FPGA <-> SPI <-> Flash/RAM interface it is very helpful to use the 4 through holes on the upper right of the FPGA, and to connect a logic analyzer to the upper right PMOD.
Remember that the default boot process leaves the Flash switched ``off``.
With the Yosys icepack command, the ``-s`` option boots the Flash in the ``on`` state.
